# Gather

This is the UI to a system that takes an address from the Greater Tulsa Metro and looks up records with the county assessor to find the current owner's name. It then looks up the address in ThatsThem.com to try and find the best phone number to reach the person. This is still in the experimental phase and isn't fully relied upon so some research is still being done in how to improve the quality of the responses.
